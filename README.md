# ðŸ“¡ Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Customer churn (when a subscriber leaves for a competitor) is a major challenge for telecom companies. This [project](https://github.com/teefortech/Telco-Customer-Churn/blob/main/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb) builds machine learning models to predict churn risk and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and represents a sample telecom providerâ€™s customer base. It includes information such as:

- Customer demographics

- Contract type

- Internet services

- Monthly charges and tenure

- Churn label (Yes/No)


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

+ Build classification models to predict customer churn.

+ Identify key factors influencing churn.

+ Provide business recommendations to reduce customer loss
